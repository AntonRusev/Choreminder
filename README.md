## What is CHOREMINDER

In short, CHOREMINDER is a basic ToDo app with some bonus features. The main bonus feature, is that the user can set up a timer for chores that have to be done repetitively, every few to several days. 

For instance, if the user has to do cardio training every other day, or if he has to clean the fish tank every couple of weeks, he can add those chores in the application, and follow the progress without having to remember when was the last time he did them. 

The interface of the application is very intuitive. In just few fast and easy steps the user can reset chores at any time, deactivate and later activate them again, or completely delete them. 

Every user has to create his own profile for his personal chores, which allows different users to share CHOREMINDER on a single device, or a single user to access his chores from multiple devices by simply logging in with his email. 

## The technical side of CHOREMINDER

CHOREMINDER is a single page application(SPA), it supports authentication and authorization, meaning that every single user can see only his own chores. 

It is being developed with React, using technologies such as Typescript and SASS, among others. 

The users have all CRUD options available to operate on their chores. 

## Status
